This version of nmerge is to be superseded by NMergeC, a complete 
rewrite of NMerge in the C language. See 
https://github.com/schmidda/nmergec. It is not yet finished and usable, 
but should soon be. The reasons for this change and the features of 
NMergeC are described at: 
http://digitalvariants.blogspot.com.au/2014/05/merging-multi-version-texts-mark-2.html 
NMerge has also been incorporated into the calliope Java web service, 
and can be called via the calliope API. See austese.net for details.
