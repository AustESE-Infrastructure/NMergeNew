This version of nmerge is to be eventually superseded by NMergeC, a complete 
rewrite of NMerge in the C language. See 
https://github.com/schmidda/nmergec. In the meantime NMergeNew is the 
preferred version of nmerge, and now boasts support for 16-bit chaaracters throughout, 
so allowing merging of non-Latin alphabets.
